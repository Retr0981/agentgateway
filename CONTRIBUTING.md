## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- PostgreSQL
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentgateway.git
cd agentgateway

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL

# Generate RSA keys
npm run generate-keys
# Copy output to .env

# Push database schema
npx prisma db push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** — follow the existing code style

3. **Test your changes** — make sure the server starts and endpoints work

4. **Commit with a descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add webhook support for trust events"
   ```

5. **Push and open a PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

## Code Style

- TypeScript for all new code
- Use `async/await` over callbacks
- Error handling: always return `{ success: false, error: "..." }` format
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR
- **Describe what and why** — not just what changed, but why
- **Reference issues** — link to related issues
- **Update docs** — if your change affects the API or setup
